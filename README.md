# 📊 Sales Performance Dashboard — Power BI Project

## 🔍 Quick Overview

This project showcases a complete end-to-end **business intelligence solution** developed with **Power BI** for a fictional B2B company, *GoodSales*. The goal was to design a **fully interactive dashboard** for executive decision-making using real-world business datasets (clients, products, sales, teams, and geography).

We built a **star schema model**, integrated multiple sources, and developed rich visuals to analyze **sales**, **margins**, **top clients**, **regional performance**, and **manager efficiency**.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Import and model multiple tables using Power BI's data model.
- Design a **star schema** centered on the `SalesOrders` fact table.
- Provide **KPI-driven insights**: sales, margin, growth, order volume.
- Offer **dynamic filtering** across year, region, manager, and client.
- Build dashboards to support **client segmentation** and **sales strategy** decisions.
